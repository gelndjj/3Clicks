### SUMMARY
This small soft can copy :
1 - Tree (directories without files)
2 - All the data from a source to an destination you choose
3 - Copy files by extensions.

### HOW IT WORKS
* Once you have selected the right tab :
1. Browse the source.
2. Browse the destination.
3. Copy.

* As soon as your files are copied, a window pops up with a list summarizing what has been copied. 
* The soft will display an error if you don't have the permissions to copy to some places.

### COPY BY EXTENSIONS

The tab _Copy .extension_ allows you to choose which kind of file you want to copy.<br />
Let's say you want to copy files with pdf extension from your Desktop to a USB drive:
1. Choose the Desktop as a source.
2. Choose the USB drive as a destination.
3. Select _PDF_ then _Copy files_.

This will copy all PDF files inside your Desktop folder (sub directories included) to the USB Drive in a folder named _Desktop_. 

### COPY TREE + DATA

The tab _Copy tree + data_ simply allows you to copy/paste

### COPY TREE 

The tab _Copy tree_ allows you to copy the tree of the source you chose. There won't be any files, just directories.
